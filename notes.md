# Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis in R

Prerequisites:

- Last version of R and Rstudio on your laptop,

I suggest that you come with at least a very basic knowledge of R, including:

- How to open, save and run an R script in Rstudio
- How to manipulate a basic dataset (dplyr)
- How to produce a simple plot from a dataset (for example a scatterplot) with ggplot2.

- The introductory chapters of any of these books.

motivation: make sense of your data.

What I can do is to point you in the right (?) direction and give you the resources that you need.

Intro: Data are everywhere in your work, how to make sense of them? Statistics can help you, R too.

Statistics is a set of tricks, procedure and methodology


# outline

In two days we will explore three dataset and use them to learn the basis of how to:

Make hypothesis
: By exploratory analysis through data visualization.

Formalize those hypothesis
: through statistical modeling

Confirm those hypothesis
: Through the Train - Test set reasoning


Aim:

- Make a Something with life sciences -- continuous response
predict height???? what is a common problem?
- Make a PCA on the (Boston???) dataset
- make a logistic regression on the cetaceans dataset
