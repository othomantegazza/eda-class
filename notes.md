# Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis in R

In this workshop, I'll introduce you to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). A part of statistics that gained attention and was formalized only recently, EDA is a set of behaviors and practices that allows you to approach a novel dataset and efficiently extract observations and hypothesis from it (i.e. to explore it). EDA is a simple and powerful concept based on effectively describing your data by quickly cycling through visualization and modeling methods.

Since EDA is an intuitive and practical approach to data analysis, (it is just a formalization of what most people do) we will learn it in a practical way, by doing.  

# Prerequisites:

You will need R and Rstudio already installed on your laptop.

Moreover, you will need to know at least a tiny bit of R before starting the workshop,

I suggest that you figure out beforehand:

- How to open, save and run an R script in Rstudio
- How to manipulate a basic dataset (dplyr)
- How to produce a simple plot from a dataset (for example a scatterplot) with ggplot2.

To learn those skills, check the introductory chapters of any of these books.

At [Bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org/) You'll find many more.

A bit of statistics? We will do with what you know, I'm still learning myself.


motivation: make sense of your data.

What I can do is to point you in the right (?) direction and give you the resources that you need.

Intro: Data are everywhere in your work, how to make sense of them? Statistics can help you, R too.

Statistics is a set of tricks, procedure and methodology


# outline

In two days we will explore three dataset and use them to learn the basis of how to:

Make hypothesis
: By exploratory analysis through data visualization.

Formalize those hypothesis
: through statistical modeling

Confirm those hypothesis
: Through the Train - Test set reasoning


Aim:

- Make a Something with life sciences -- continuous response
predict height???? what is a common problem?
- Make a PCA on the (Boston???) dataset
- make a logistic regression on the cetaceans dataset
