## Why Data Analysis for Biologists

As a biologist, you'll often find yourself dealing with data.

Your experiment, be it phenotype measurements, gene expression analysis, genomic comparisons, will produce data. 

To understand your results and to explain them to others, you'll have to be able to make sense of those data.

## Why Data Analysis in R

No need, pick the software that suits your needs, use many of them and feel free to change.

R has some advantages: 

- It's professional and open source,
- It has great packages for data manipulation and visualization,
- It has powerful tools for communicating of your results,
- It has clear, extensive and user friendly documentation,
- It is powerful and easy to use.

## Learn by doing

Check out the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), it's a weekly Social project on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TidyTuesday).

Do it frequently and you'll learn to analyze data in R with a friendly and welcoming community.

## Resources

[Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/), has wonderful books on data analysis in R that you can consult openly online.

You might want to start from [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).

## Load your data into R

If you want to analyze data in R, first you have to load them. 

You can do it with [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) and [readxl](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/). These two packages cover two very common data formats: text rectangular data (csv, tsv) and excel data.

## Plot - Visualize your data

If you know how to visualize your data in graphs and plots you're half way there. You can use plots both to explore your data and to communicate your results.

You can use [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), an R package for data visualization. You can find guides on how to use it  [on its website](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) or in [this chapter of r4ds](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html).

## Wrangle - Manipulate your data

Sometime you have manipulate your datasets: you might want to filter them or to change, remove, add new columns to your data.

You can manipulate your data with [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), learn how to use this R package [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html) or [in this chapter of r4ds](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html).
