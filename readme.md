# :milky_way: Material for an upcoming course in EDA

:rocket: Work in progress :construction_worker: 


## :notes: Info

The course will be hands-on. We have access to a computer room, but if it is possible, I would **suggest** you to **bring your own laptop**. In this you will be sure to have R and Rstudio installed on your laptop, and after the workshop you will be ready to start making your own data explorations.


### :hammer: Tools

:floppy_disk: You can install R and Rstudio to your laptop.

- :link: [R - CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- :link: [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

Afterwards, you can install the [Tidyverse :milky_way:](https://www.tidyverse.org/), which collects most of the packages that we will use for our explorations. To install it, open Rstudio  and type in your R console:

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

If you get any :x: error message, we will fix it together :sparkler:.


Otherwise, [Rstudio :cloud: cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) let's you run Rstudio in cloud computing.


## :books: Resources

The R community is active online, and committed to create a friendly and welcoming environment for new everybody.

This includes writing outsanding :book: open access material that you can use to learn R :whale:.
