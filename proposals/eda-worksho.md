# Introduction

In this workshop, I'll introduce you to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). A part of statistics that gained attention and that was formalized only recently, EDA is a set of approaches and practices that allows you to explore a novel dataset and to extract efficiently observations and hypothesis from it.

In this course you'll learn how to effectively analyze your data by quickly cycling through visualization and modeling methods.

Since EDA is an intuitive and practical approach to data analysis, we will learn it in a practical way, by analyzing together various datasets in R.  

# Outline

In two days, on real datasets,we will learn the basis of how to make hypothesis on data and how to test them.

Day 1
: Learn how to detect patterns in your data by visualizing and transforming them.

Day 2
: Learn how to test hypothesis on your data with statistical models.

# Prerequisites:

You will need [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) installed on your laptop.

Moreover, you will need to know at least a tiny bit of R before starting the workshop,

I suggest that you figure out beforehand:

- How to open, save and run an R script in Rstudio
- How to manipulate a basic dataset (dplyr)
- How to produce a simple plot from a dataset (for example a scatterplot) with ggplot2.
- A bit of statistics? We will do with what you know, I'm still learning myself.

To learn those skills, check the introductory chapters of any of these books.

At [Bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org/) You'll find many more.

# Take Home

1. How to quickly produce many exploratory plots with `ggplot2`.

2. Basic modeling in R, how to produce many models.

3. Train - Test set reasoning to formulate and test hypothesis on data.
