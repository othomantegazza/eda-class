Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in R
================

Most experiments produce data, and if you are able to analyze those data
efficiently, you’ll have an edge on your work.

[**EDA**](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html) is a
practical and empirical approach to data analysis. It does not require
strong mathematical basis, and it teaches you how to approach your data
empirically, and how to build assumptions and hypothesis step by step.

In this workshop we will learn EDA in R.

# Topics

The topics for the workshop are:

1.  Reading/Loading Data,
2.  Tidying and transforming Data,
3.  Visualization,
4.  Modeling (just a tiny bit)

Which are all skills that you’ll need to explore your data.

# Tools (R)

We will do everything in R with
[**Tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages, for their
technical superiority. We will start from the basis and **you can join
also if you are new to R**.

# Datasets

We will learn those topics by exploring and analyzing together real life
datasets.

We will start from a simple one, that can be loaded in R and visualized
directly, and move to a more complicated one that must be tidied and
transformed before it can be explored and visualized, and, last, we will
explore one that requires also some level of statistical modeling to
extract and detect the information that it contains.

I plan to take the datasets from the
[**Tidytuesday**](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) repo,
which is a weekly social project in R, and a great tool to practice EDA.

The dataset could be:

1.  (Easy) [**Nobel Prize
    Winners**](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2019/2019-05-14/nobel_winners.csv),
    which can be loaded and visualized right away,
2.  (Medium) [**Malaria
    Atlas**](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2018/2018-11-13),
    which requires some cleaning and aggregation before it can be
    explored and visualized
3.  (Difficult) [**Police Stop
    Counts**](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-03-19)
    Which could be modeled as Poisson. (or maybe we could use directly
    the count matrix of a multivariate RNAseq to get into to the
    molecular theme).

# Duration

The workshop will last 3 days.
