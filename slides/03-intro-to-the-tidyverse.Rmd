# GGPLOT2 for Data Visualization

.pull-left[

.middle[

GGPLOT2 is a library for graphical representation of Data.


- It is widely developed, you can use it to plot almost anything,
- It is based on the Layered Grammar of Graphics,
- It's designed both for exploratory viz and for communiacation

To get used to ggplot you must think in a layered way.

# The Grammar of Graphics

You map **data**...

1. to **Aesthetic** properties of objects,
2. according **Scale**, placed on **Coordinates**
3. Those objects are represented by **Geometric Shapes**.
4. You might need to use **statistical** transformations, to highlight those properties,
5. You might want to use **Facets** to represent multiple dimentions

Show the number of squirrels by their primary and highlight fur colour in a barchart.

- Map the **highlight fur colour** to the **x axis**. Can you make the x axis vertical?

- Map the **primary fur colour** to the **fill aesthetic** of the bars.

- What are you mapping to the y axis, can you order the bars by their height?

- Can you map the **primary for colour** to their real colours?

Use an histogram to visualize how are the black squirrels distributed along the longitude variable.

- If you map the longitude on the x axis, which variable are you mapping on the y axis?

- Are you using a statistical transformation?

Can you show where are the squirrels with a scatterplot? 

- Map the **longitude** to the **x axis** and the **latitude** to the **y axis**.

- Map the colour of the points to the real fur colour of the squirrels.

- Can you also split the fur colours in facets?

- How can you avoid overplotting? Can you bin the squirrel position on the x and y axis?
