Data is the present.

It is not the future, not something that we must prepare for. Data is the present. Most sectors today produce and deal with masssive datasets and databases. And the same is for research: at this moment data are cheap to come by, eterogeneous and everywhere.


## 01 - Let's make an histogram

### Load Data:

- Everything in R is an object:
  - how to assign an object to a variable,
  - Every object has a type,
  - We will use mostly tibbles, which are rectangular data,
- To do anything, you need functions:
  - what is a function? Take input, makes steps, give outputs.
  - you can write a function, or see what a function does.
  - We find functions in packages,
- Packages are a collection of functions and documentation.
  - You can install packages from CRAN,
  - Load the packages to use the functions.
  
### Rectangular Data:

- Rows and columns,
- in R they work columnwise,
- concept  of tidydata.

## 02 - Let's make a scatterplot

### Manipulate Data

- how do you modify data in R,
- Many ways to do one thing - open source,

### DPLYR

- Tell your computer how to achive what you want vs declarative language. (SQL)
- Common dplyr verbs (function),
- the pipe

## GGPLOT2

- what does it mean to do a plot
- Map data to aesthetic property of geometric objects,
- layered elements
- theory of graphical data visualization.
